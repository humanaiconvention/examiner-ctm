# Fonts for Logo Export

Place `Inter-Regular.ttf` in this directory to enable outlined wordmark export.

The export script (`scripts/export-logo.tsx`) will attempt to load `assets/fonts/Inter-Regular.ttf` when invoked with `--outline` or when `LOGO_OUTLINE=1`.

Licensing: Ensure you have the proper license for Inter (SIL Open Font License) before distributing. Do not commit proprietary font files without permission.

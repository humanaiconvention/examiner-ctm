This summit creates an independent, transparent forum where everyday people can shape the future of AI."},{q:"Why us?",a:"True stewardship must come from independent citizens, not institutions with political or profit pressures. Only a diverse, unaffiliated group can guarantee neutrality, fresh perspectives, and trust."},{q:"What will this summit do?",a:"<ul><li>Define AI alignment principles reflecting human values and collective wellbeing</li><li>Establish measurable goals to guide AI systems' societal impact</li><li>Set operational boundaries and guardrails against harmful outputs</li><li>Identify transparency, accountability, and human‑in‑the‑loop checkpoints</li><li>Draft and iterate a living charter that evolves with technology and norms</li></ul>"},{q:"Who will participate?",a:"A globally stratified sample of ~1,000 citizens, balanced across geography, culture, age, gender, education, and socioeconomic background, supported by facilitators, subject‑matter experts, and process stewards."},{q:"How is representation ensured?",a:"Through layered sampling: regional population weighting, within‑region demographic stratification, and random selection in each stratum, with adjustments for clustering effects to maximize diversity and fairness."},{q:"What is the Human Thread?",a:"An interactive visual tool showing the living connections between individual voices, themes, and the evolving charter language — letting anyone trace ideas from origin through deliberation to inclusion."},{q:"How will deliberation work?",a:"Participants move between plenary briefings and small, facilitated panels. Discussions combine lived experience with expert input, iterating draft language until broad consensus is reached."},{q:"How is consent handled?",a:"Through a modular consent framework allowing participants to choose which data, quotes, and media can be shared — with AES-256 encrypted anonymization pipelines using cryptographic pseudonymous IDs (SHA-3-512) ensuring privacy without erasing impact. All identity data stored in air-gapped HSM systems with k-anonymity (k≥5) protections."},{q:"What about accessibility?",a:"All sessions are designed for multi‑modal access: captions, transcripts, screen‑reader‑ready materials, plain‑language summaries, translation, and options for asynchronous participation."},{q:"How will the output be used?",a:"The living charter will be open‑sourced and promoted to AI developers, policymakers, civil society, and the public as a global alignment touchstone, with transparent version history and participation memory."},{q:"Will this be repeated?",a:"Yes — the process is designed to be iterative, with future assemblies reconvening to amend and expand the charter as technology and society evolve."},{q:"Who is organizing this?",a:"An independent coalition of civic technologists, deliberative democracy experts, accessibility advocates, and ethical governance architects — unaffiliated with governments or corporations."},{q:"How is it funded?",a:"Through transparent, diversified funding — small donations, public grants, and philanthropic contributions — with public ledgers and caps to prevent influence concentration."},{q:"Can I observe or contribute if I'm not selected?",a:"Yes — all plenary sessions will be streamed, with open commentary channels, mirrored documents for suggestions, and space in the Human Thread to connect your ideas to the process."},{q:"How are expert inputs chosen?",a:"Via a public nomination and vetting process with transparent criteria and conflict‑of‑interest disclosures.

How we work

Approach

We combine open-source tools, rigorous evaluation, and community governance to ensure research is reproducible and aligned with public benefit.

Key practices

- Publish machine-readable ModuleEthicsProfiles for every new module (see web/src/lib/ethics.ts and CONVENTION_PRINCIPLES.md).
- Include tests that exercise evaluator rules before merge.
- Estimate resource budgets (energy, network) per interaction and publish budgets alongside modules.
- Provide exportable artifacts and provenance for user-contributed data so downstream reuse is auditable.

Operational notes

Modules and tiles should include `ethics:profileRef` extensions and linkage to the ModuleEthicsProfile to enable automated gating and review.

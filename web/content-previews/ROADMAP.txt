Roadmap (indicative)

Phase 1 — Baseline evaluator & profiles

- Implement baseline evaluator and `ModuleEthicsProfile` shape.
- Publish tests and reference implementations (ethics.ts, tests).

Phase 2 — Energy & network estimation

- Refine per-interaction energy and network estimation models and include them in profile metadata.

Phase 3 — Bundle-level compliance summaries

- Produce JSON reports summarizing bundle compliance, SBOM drift, and attestations.

Phase 4 — Cryptographic attestation

- Add build provenance and cryptographic attestations (Cosign signatures / provenance) for critical components.

Phase 5 — Privacy modules

- Explore differential privacy modules as opt-in extensions.

Engagement

We welcome contributors across law, ethics, technical design, and community governance to help prioritize and refine these phases.

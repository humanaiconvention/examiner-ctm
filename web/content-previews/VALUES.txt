Our values

Ethical commitments

- Bounded consent: Scope, retention, and purpose are explicit and minimal.
- Informed: Plain-language disclosures of what is collected and shared.
- Transparent: Source code, provenance, and decision criteria are inspectable.
- Revocable: Participants can withdraw future participation without punitive consequences.
- Proportional: Safeguards aligned with data and model sensitivity.
- Accountable: Verifiable event trails for audit (non-PII by default).

Context

These commitments are drawn from the project's foundational principles (see CONVENTION_PRINCIPLES.md). They guide module design, tile metadata, and contributor governance.

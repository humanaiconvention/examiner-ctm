Governance

Principles & process

- Changes to core principles require a semantic version bump of the principles document. (CONVENTION_PRINCIPLES.md)
- Each proposed change must include a benefit vs. risk analysis and at least one alternative considered.
- Automated compliance tests must cover the evaluator rules; modules failing core checks should be gated from mainline deployments.

Automated checks

Modules must publish a `ModuleEthicsProfile` (see web/src/lib/ethics.ts) containing: id, version, declaredPurposes, dataCategories, retentionDays, consentRequired, sensitive, and optional resource estimates.

Contribution checklist (before merging a new module)

- Provide `ModuleEthicsProfile` with declaredPurposes & dataCategories.
- Add tests confirming evaluator classification.
- Document export capability & retention.
- Reference the profile from produced tiles.
